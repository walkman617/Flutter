# Good for beginners
If you’re new to Flutter, we recommend starting with one of these codelabs:

## 1. [Write your first Flutter app, part 1](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt1/) <br/>

- Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. 
- In part one, you’ll use a package that returns pairs of words at random and inserts them into an infinite scrolling list.

## 2. [Write Your First Flutter App, part 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2/)<br>

- Create a simple mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. 
- In part two, you’ll extend the example from part 1 to allow the user to select favorite word pairs, and add a second “Saved Favorites” page where users can view the selected names. 
- Finally, you’ll change the app’s theme color.

## 3. [Write your first Flutter app on the web](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab-web)
